## Read-in variables
* `x_train` is the data readed from the table of `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train` is the data readed from the table of `y_train.txt`.
* `x_test` is the data readed from the table of `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test` is the data readed from the table of `y_test.txt`.
* `subject_train` is the data readed from the table of `subject_train.txt'.
* `subject_test` is the data readed from the table of `subject_test.txt'.
* `features` is the data readed from the table of `features.txt'.
* `activity_labels` is the data readed from the table of `activity_labels.txt'.

## Merged variables
* `x_merged` is merged from `x_train` and `x_test` by `rbind` function; and then is subsetted by `mean_std_feat`.
* `y_merged` is merged from `y_train` and `y_test` by `rbind` function; and then is updated by `activity_labels`.
* `subject_merged` is merged from `subject_train` and `subject_test` by `rbind` function.

## Other variables
* `mean_std_feat` is the indices where contain `-mean()` or `-std()` in the feature names.
* `all_data` is all the final data that merged from x_merged, y_merged, subject_merged by cbind.
* `average_data` is generated by `ddply` to calculate each average of each combination of 6 activities and 30 subjects.
